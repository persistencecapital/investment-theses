        <div class="content-section">
            <h2 class="section-heading">The Multi-Chain Future</h2>
            <p class="body-text">
                The 'multi-chain' thesis continues to be the probabilistic future. This hypothesis has been further reinforced in recent months with investment banks (JP Morgan), tech giants (Google), payment providers (Stripe), stablecoin issuers (Circle) and leading applications (Pump.fun) all indicating they'll launch their own Layer-1 (blockchain).
            </p>
            
            <h2 class="section-heading">Consumer Wallet Requirements</h2>
            <p class="body-text">
                For consumer products like wallets to succeed they will need to be natively cross-chain. This means overcoming significant structural challenges that limit this being done effectively today. As well as being inherently cross-chain, they will need to challenge the experience provided today by custody providers (Central Exchanges) with superior security like institutional products (Fireblocks).
            </p>
            
            <h3 class="sub-heading">Two Successful Approaches</h3>
            <p class="body-text">We are seeing two successful approaches to capture this emerging category:</p>
            <ul class="bullet-list">
                <li>Incumbents such as custody providers offering more decentralised offerings i.e. DeFi access</li>
                <li>Self-custody providers plugging in third-party applications to make a more seamless and secure experience</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="body-text">
                This will not be a winner take all market, so both incumbents who can 'disrupt from within' and start-ups who can move fast can succeed. Both approaches will take a lot of effort.
            </p>
        </div>
        
        <!-- Market Validation -->
        <div class="content-section">
            <h2 class="section-heading">Market Validation: Infinex</h2>
            <p class="body-text">
                A validation of both the market and start-up approach is Infinex. They successfully raised $70m at a $500m valuation to build a CeDeFi wallet. They have used a pseudo-points system to incentivise new users to sign-up, bring TVL and use the product. The assumption then has to be that the product is so good that these users will stick.
            </p>
            <p class="body-text">
                Infinex have done well to a) move quickly b) plug in third-party apps i.e. relay link for cross-chain swaps c) create incentives d) raise a lot of money at a crazy valuation. Yet their crazy high valuation provides very limited upside for investors. Additionally, their technology stack is complicated due to the number of third-party modules required to facilitate use cases such as cross-chain swaps. This adds risk.
            </p>

        <!-- Beacon Opportunity -->
        <div class="content-section">
            <h2 class="section-heading">Beacon: Positioned for Success</h2>
            <p class="body-text">
                Beacon is well positioned to succeed in this emerging category. The combination of the following puts them in a strong position:
            </p>
            <ul class="bullet-list">
                <li>Market opportunity</li>
                <li>Superior technological approach</li>
                <li>Attractive incentives</li>
            </ul>
            
            <div class="highlight-box">
                <p class="body-text">
                    <strong>By leveraging their breakthrough cross-chain smart contract technology, Beacon enables users to interact with any asset (trade, stake, earn, automate), on any blockchain (Solana, Ethereum, Bitcoin, Doge et al), without sacrificing control (to custodians like CEX and bridges), through a single unified interface with institutional grade security (biometrics, multi-party-computation, social recovery).</strong>
                </p>
            </div>
            
            <h3 class="sub-heading">Competitive Advantage</h3>
            <p class="body-text">
                The combination of superior product + attractive incentives should allow them to gain market share just like Hyperliquid did in the competitive perpetuals market. At the current fundraise valuation of $10m FDV (2% of Infinex valuation), there is significant upside for investors and early users. The playbook has been validated. Ultimately it will come down to execution.
            </p>
            
            <h3 class="sub-heading">Go-to-Market Strategy</h3>
            <p class="body-text">
                The team has a strong go-to-market strategy leveraging partners to help with distribution as well as market volume and depth.
            </p>
            
            <h3 class="sub-heading">Market Timing</h3>
            <p class="body-text">
                The market timing and vesting terms are highly opportunistic. The market has the odds of a rate cut now at 97% on polymarket - this announcement will coincide with the Beacon TGE. When considering where we are in the four year debt / global liquidity cycle and bitcoin halving life-cycle, it is anticipated there will be significant liquidity flowing to 'risk on' assets with asymmetric upside opportunities.
